## Introduction

Code Metro (Codeigniter Metro UI CSS) kick starts the development process of the web development process by including Metro UI CSS into CodeIgniter.
With this custom Codeigniter framework, you can make a site with an metro UI interface.

Code Metro follows the path where it lazy loads libraries. Though the project footprint may be large, the memory footprint will still be extremely light. Try not to autoload libraries as it does not follow the CodeIgniter convention (though some libraries do make sense to autoload).
